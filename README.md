# ðŸ§  Patho-Scope AI

An Intelligent Digital Workbench for Histopathology Analysis. Patho-Scope AI uses a locally trained TensorFlow model to classify histopathology images into five cancer types, then leverages Google Gemini for AI-generated medical explanations. It is built as a lightweight Flask web application with MongoDB storage.
